#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to solve, develop, maintain and improve software systems. It's plays a crucial role in the technology industry by the creation of systems and applications software which are used to facilitate our modern life, for example communication, transportation and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Waterfall Model: The Waterfall model was introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce in 1970, it was one of the first formalized software development methodologies. It focused on a linear and sequential approach to software development, in which each phase of development (requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance) has to be completed before the next phase could begin. This model emphasized thorough documentation and was widely adopted in industries requiring rigorous, structured processes.
2. Creation of Agile Methodologies: The Agile Manifesto, was published in 2001, marking a significant shift in software development practices. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development. Unlike the rigid Waterfall model, the Agile model allowed for frequent reassessment and adaptation, leading to faster delivery of functional software and better alignment with customer needs.
3. The Rise of DevOps: DevOps emerged in the late 2000s as a cultural and technical movement aimed at bridging the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It introduced practices like continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), automated testing, and infrastructure as code, enabling more efficient, reliable, and rapid software delivery. DevOps has since become integral to modern software engineering, fostering collaboration across teams and accelerating the development lifecycle.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: This planning phase involves defining the project's scope, objectives, and feasibility. Cost, resources and other aspects are estimated, and a guide is created for the development process.
2. Requirements Analysis: During this phase, the functional and non-functional requirements of the software are gathered and documented. Stakeholders are interviewed, and use cases are developed to understand what the software should achieve.
3. Design: In this phase, the software’s architecture and design are defined. This includes the overall system architecture, user interfaces, databases, and other components. Detailed specifications are created to guide development.
4. Coding: This is the phase where the actual code is written. Developers use the design specifications to build the software. This phase is often the most time-consuming, as it involves writing and testing the code.
5. Testing: The developed software is tested to identify and fix defects. This phase is made to ensure that the software functions as intended, meets the requirements of the design, and is free of critical bugs. Various types of testing are carried out here, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
6. Deployment: Once the software passes testing, it is deployed to a production environment where it can be used by the end-users. This phase may also include user training and documentation.
7. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves monitoring the software for any issues, fixing bugs, and making updates or enhancements as needed to keep the software relevant and efficient.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
•	Structure: Waterfall is linear and rigid, while Agile is iterative and flexible.
•	Flexibility: Agile is better suited for projects with evolving requirements, whereas Waterfall is more appropriate for projects with well-defined and unchanging requirements.
•	Client Involvement: Agile involves the client throughout the project, while Waterfall typically involves the client at the beginning and the end.
•	Documentation: Waterfall places a strong emphasis on documentation, while Agile prioritizes working software but still maintains necessary documentation.

	Appropriate Scenarios for Waterfall methodologies:
	Construction Projects: Where any changes made mid-project would be costly therefore the requirements are clearly defined from the start.
	Large-Scale Enterprise Applications: Where the end goal is well-understood, and the process requires strict documentation and control.
	Regulated Industries: Where compliance and documentation are critical, such as healthcare or finance.

	Appropriate Scenarios for agile methodologies:
	Startups: Where rapid development and the ability to pivot based on user feedback are crucial.
	Software Products: Where ongoing development and frequent updates are needed, such as SaaS (Software as a Service) products.
	Research and Development Projects: Where the final outcome is not clearly defined, and the project needs to evolve based on ongoing discoveries.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing is a critical component of Software Quality Assurance (SQA), ensuring that software meets the required standards for functionality, reliability, and performance. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of testing—unit, integration, system, and acceptance—and their importance in the software development process:

1. Unit Testing
Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation to verify that each part functions correctly. A "unit" is typically the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class.
Importance:
	Early Bug Detection: Unit tests help identify bugs at an early stage, making it easier and less costly to fix issues before they propagate.
	Code Quality: Writing unit tests encourages developers to write modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
	Documentation: Unit tests serve as documentation for the code, helping other developers understand the expected behavior of individual components.
Example: Testing a function that calculates the sum of two numbers to ensure it returns the correct result for various input combinations.

2. Integration Testing
Integration testing focuses on verifying that different modules or components of the application work together as expected. This type of testing is conducted after unit testing and before system testing.
Importance:
	Identifying Interface Issues: Integration testing helps detect issues that occur when different components interact, such as mismatches in data formats or communication protocols.
	Validation of Component Interaction: It ensures that the integrated components produce the correct outputs when working together.
	Reduced Risk of Failures: By testing interactions between modules early, integration testing reduces the likelihood of failures when the system is fully assembled.
Example: Testing the interaction between a user interface and the backend service that processes user input.

3. System Testing
System testing involves testing the complete and integrated application as a whole. This testing validates the software’s overall functionality, performance, and compliance with specified requirements.
Importance:
	End-to-End Validation: System testing verifies that the entire system works as intended, ensuring that all components and features function correctly together.
	Requirement Verification: It ensures that the software meets the functional and non-functional requirements defined in the specifications.
	Comprehensive Coverage: System testing covers various aspects such as usability, security, and performance, providing a thorough assessment of the software.
Example: Testing an e-commerce application’s full workflow, including product search, order placement, payment processing, and order confirmation.

4. Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end-user. This testing is usually conducted by the client or end-users and often includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
Importance:
	Validation of Business Needs: Acceptance testing ensures that the software fulfills the business needs and meets the acceptance criteria defined by the stakeholders.
	Final Approval: It provides the final verification before the software is released to production, ensuring that it is ready for deployment.
	User Satisfaction: By involving end-users in testing, acceptance testing ensures that the software is user-friendly and meets user expectations.
Example: Testing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system by having the actual users simulate real-world scenarios to verify that the system meets their needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is about crafting your question or statements in a way, that helps to get the best response from an AI or a Robot assistant. 
The importance of prompt engineering:
It helps the user to avoid asking vague questions that might give a confusing answer.
It also helps in creating a concise and direct question and not repeating the same question in different forms.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague question is “Tell me about football”. Such a question may bring so many different replies about football that may not be useful to you but if the question is changed to “Tell me about the best players in European football during the past 20 years” you’ll get a more focused response.
The improved prompt is very effective because it guides the AI towards the kind of response you are looking for, it also helps the AI understand your request properly.
